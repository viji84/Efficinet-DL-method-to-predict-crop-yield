## ⚙️ **System Workflow**

1. **Data Collection**: Extract data from reliable agricultural sources.  
2. **Data Preprocessing**:  
   - **Scaling Numerical Features**: Normalize values to a comparable range (e.g., 0 to 1).  
   - **Encoding Categorical Variables**: Convert non-numeric columns (e.g., Crop, Season, State) into numeric format using label encoding.  
   - **Handling Missing Values**: Apply mean or median imputation for numerical columns and mode imputation for categorical ones.  
   - **Feature and Target Separation**: Split the dataset into independent variables (features) and the dependent variable (target: crop yield).  
   - **Data Splitting**: Divide data into training (60%), validation (20%), and testing (20%) sets.  
3. **Model Training**:  
   - Train six models with ReLU/Sigmoid activation functions.  
   - Use early stopping to prevent overfitting.  
4. **Prediction Module**:  
   - Feed preprocessed data into trained models.  
   - Generate crop yield predictions.  
5. **Evaluation**:  
   - Analyze model performance using metrics like MAE, MSE, and R².
