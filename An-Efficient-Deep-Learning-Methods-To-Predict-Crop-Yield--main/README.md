# üåæ **An Efficient Deep Learning Method to Predict Crop Yield**

## üìú **Project Overview**
This project focuses on using efficient **deep learning methods** to predict crop yields accurately. Models like Feed Forward Neural Networks (FNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) were evaluated for their ability to analyze agricultural and environmental data, offering insights for sustainable agriculture.

### **Key Highlights:**
- Evaluation of models: **FNN**, **LSTM**, **CNN**, **GRU**, **RNN**, and **MLP**.
- Dataset includes essential features like crop type, season, area, production,rainfall and environmental conditions.
- Metrics like **MAE**, **MSE**, and **R¬≤** are used for performance evaluation.
- Visualizations for better understanding of model performance and results.

## ‚öôÔ∏è **System Workflow**

1. **Data Collection**: Extract data from reliable agricultural sources.  
2. **Data Preprocessing**:  
   - **Scaling Numerical Features**: Normalize values to a comparable range (e.g., 0 to 1).  
   - **Encoding Categorical Variables**: Convert non-numeric columns (e.g., Crop, Season, State) into numeric format using label encoding.  
   - **Handling Missing Values**: Apply mean or median imputation for numerical columns and mode imputation for categorical ones.  
   - **Feature and Target Separation**: Split the dataset into independent variables (features) and the dependent variable (target: crop yield).  
   - **Data Splitting**: Divide data into training (60%), validation (20%), and testing (20%) sets.  
3. **Model Training**:  
   - Train six models with ReLU/Sigmoid activation functions.  
   - Use early stopping to prevent overfitting.  
4. **Prediction Module**:  
   - Feed preprocessed data into trained models.  
   - Generate crop yield predictions.  
5. **Evaluation**:  
   - Analyze model performance using metrics like MAE, MSE, and R¬≤.
